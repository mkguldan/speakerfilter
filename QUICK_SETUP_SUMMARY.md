# ⚡ Quick Setup Summary - You're Almost There!

## ✅ What You Have So Far

**Your Projects:**
- GCP Project: `speakerfilter` ✅
- Firebase Project: `speakerfilter-1a251` ✅
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter ✅

**GitHub Secrets Already Added:**
- `GCP_SA_KEY` ✅
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` ✅

**Airtable Credentials:**
- PAT Token: ✅ (you have this)
- Base ID: ⏳ (you'll get this later)
- Table Name: ⏳ (you'll get this later)

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Add 3 More GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)

Go to: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" and add:

**Secret #1:**
- Name: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
- Value: `speakerfilter`

**Secret #2:**
- Name: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- Value: `speakerfilter-1a251`

**Secret #3:**
- Name: `BACKEND_URL`
- Value: (leave empty for now, we'll add this after first deployment)

---

### Step 2: Set Up Google Secret Manager (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Quick Setup (When You Have Base ID & Table Name)

Run this PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\setup_secrets.ps1
```

It will prompt you for:
- Your Airtable Base ID
- Your Airtable Table Name

The script automatically:
- ✅ Creates secrets in Google Secret Manager
- ✅ Grants Cloud Run access
- ✅ Shows you the console link to verify

#### Option B: Manual Setup (Do It Later)

If you don't have Base ID/Table Name yet, you can do this later with individual commands:

```powershell
# When you have your Base ID:
echo "appXXXXXXXXXXXX" | gcloud secrets create AIRTABLE_BASE_ID --data-file=-

# When you have your Table Name:
echo "2511 Barclays status view" | gcloud secrets create AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME --data-file=-

# Grant access to Cloud Run (run once after creating secrets)
$PROJECT_NUMBER = gcloud projects describe speakerfilter --format="value(projectNumber)"
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding AIRTABLE_BASE_ID --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

---

### Step 3: Push to GitHub (1 minute)

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd G:\IR\AI\speakerfilter

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add Google Secret Manager integration for secure credential storage"

# Push (this will trigger deployment!)
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 4: Watch Deployment (5-10 minutes)

Go to: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/actions

Watch the workflows:
- ✅ Backend deployment (will succeed if secrets are set up)
- ⏳ Frontend deployment (will succeed after we add BACKEND_URL)

---

### Step 5: Get Backend URL & Update Secret (2 minutes)

After backend deploys successfully:

```powershell
# Get the backend URL
gcloud run services describe speaker-filter-backend --region us-central1 --format="value(status.url)"
```

Copy the URL (e.g., `https://speaker-filter-backend-xyz-uc.a.run.app`)

Then:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/settings/secrets/actions
2. Find `BACKEND_URL` secret (or create it if you skipped it)
3. Click "Update" (or "New repository secret")
4. Paste the backend URL
5. Save

---

### Step 6: Trigger Frontend Deployment (1 minute)

```powershell
# Make a commit to trigger redeployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Add backend URL for frontend"
git push origin main
```

Go back to: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/actions

Watch frontend deploy successfully! ✅

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

After all steps complete, you'll have:

✅ **Backend deployed to:** `https://speaker-filter-backend-[random].run.app`  
✅ **Frontend deployed to:** `https://speakerfilter-1a251.web.app`  
✅ **Secrets securely stored** in Google Secret Manager  
✅ **CI/CD pipeline** automatically deploying on every push

---

## 📊 Architecture You Built

```
GitHub Push
    ↓
GitHub Actions CI/CD
    ↓
    ├─→ Backend → GCP Cloud Run → Google Secret Manager (Airtable creds)
    └─→ Frontend → Firebase Hosting
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Airtable credentials in Google Secret Manager (not visible anywhere!)
- ✅ Service account keys only in GitHub (encrypted)
- ✅ Backend fetches secrets at runtime
- ✅ No secrets in code or environment variables

---

## 🔍 Quick Verification

After everything deploys, test:

```powershell
# Test backend health
curl https://your-backend-url.run.app/health

# Test Airtable connection
curl https://your-backend-url.run.app/api/test-connection

# Open frontend
start https://speakerfilter-1a251.web.app
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**Deployment fails?**
- Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/actions
- Verify all GitHub Secrets are set correctly
- Check Secret Manager permissions

**Backend can't connect to Airtable?**
- Verify secrets exist in Google Secret Manager
- Check permissions with: `gcloud secrets list`
- View Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run services logs read speaker-filter-backend --region us-central1`

**Frontend can't connect to backend?**
- Verify `BACKEND_URL` secret is set correctly
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Check browser console for errors
