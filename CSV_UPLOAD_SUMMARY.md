# 🎉 CSV Upload Feature - Ready to Use!

## ✅ What's Changed

I've completely pivoted the application from **Airtable integration** to **CSV file upload**! This means:

- ❌ **No Airtable API needed** - Skip all that configuration
- ❌ **No Google Secret Manager needed** - Much simpler
- ❌ **No API keys or tokens needed** - Just upload and go
- ✅ **Upload CSV files** - Drag & drop up to 1GB
- ✅ **Works immediately** - No setup required
- ✅ **Test right away** - Export from Airtable and upload

---

## 🚀 How to Use (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Get Your CSV
Export from Airtable:
```
1. Open your Airtable base
2. Go to your status view
3. Click ... menu → "Download CSV"
4. Save the file
```

### Step 2: Deploy (Only GitHub Secrets Needed)

You now only need **5 GitHub Secrets** (much simpler!):

Go to: https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter/settings/secrets/actions

Add:
1. `GCP_PROJECT_ID` = `speakerfilter`
2. `GCP_SA_KEY` = (JSON from service account) ✅ You have this
3. `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` = `speakerfilter-1a251`
4. `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` = (JSON from Firebase) ✅ You have this
5. `BACKEND_URL` = (empty for now, add after deployment)

**That's it!** No Airtable secrets needed!

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```powershell
# Initialize git (if not done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add CSV upload feature - no Airtable needed!"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mkguldan/speakerfilter.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Use the App

1. Open your deployed app
2. **Drag & drop your CSV file** into the upload box
3. Enter event name (e.g., "2511 Barclays")
4. Click "Filter Speakers"
5. View results and export!

## 📋 Required CSV Columns

Your CSV needs these exact column names:

- `Name` - Speaker name
- `Workshops` - Event tags ("2511 Barclays Confirmed", etc.)
- `Axel's rating` - Numeric rating
- `Notes speaker calls` - Call notes with "In sum" sections
- `Jelena's comments` - Comments with ratings
- `Abstract` - Speaker abstract
- `Company` - Speaker's company
- `Region` - Geographic region
- `IR Speaking engagement` - IR ratings
- `Activity notes` - Activity log

**Good news:** When you export from Airtable, these columns come automatically!
